Trimsite
========

Trimsite provides a basic framework for small websites, typically consisting of 4 or 5 pages.  It started life as a teaching example, demonstrating the principles of HTML5 and CSS3.  However, it became clear that it also can make the process of producing a simple website quick and painless.  From version 4, TrimSite is now much easier to extend for more complex websites.

Because at heart it is a teaching example, it also demonstrates the principles of responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.

The fundamental thinking behind Trimsite is that it is good to "KISS your DRY SOCks":

* KISS: Keep It Stupidly Simple
* DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
* SOCks: observe the principle of Separation Of Concerns

So basically, Trimsite is set up as far as possible so that it is never necessary to make a change in more than one place (DRY), and so that page content, page styling, and page structure are handled in entirely separate files (SOC).

It's very easy to add functionality to Trimsite, such as file handling, blog display, and an auto-generated photo gallery.  However, the idea is that this project should be simple, so Trimsite aims to stay "lean and mean" whilst the related "TrimSite Extras" project makes these various extras easily available.
