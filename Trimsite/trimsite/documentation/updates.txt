Made a start on updating the CSS templates to allow for nested sub-menus.  So far, have 
sorted:
- ecs-module-4.css
- trimsite4.css
- back-pic4.css

Notes:

Major update to version 4.0:
This is not a big change in terms of lines of code, but huge in terms of concept.  The 
menu is now built by a separate *recursive* method in the webpage class.  This means it 
can handle sub-menus, sub-sub-menus and sub menus nested to any depth you like 
(apparently it might break if one were to try to recurse to a depth of 99 or 100, 
though...).

Implications:
1) The basic TrimSite package should now handle:
   - pages being put in sub-directories, and 
   - sub/sub-sub menu structures
   without any changes to the TrimSite code.
2) TrimSitePlus is now redundant.
3) The example CSS files will need updating to display nested sub-menus.

It will all also need proper testing ;-)

Notes:
* Small update to back-pic.css to fix the background picture.

--- end of update ---

Time: 	 16-12-16, 16:33h
Coder:	 David
Notes:
Updated for version 3.5:
* The path parameter is now completely removed, so TrimSite works out the various bits of 
  path info for itself (page name, path to page, path from page to the <trimsite> 
  directory, path from website rrot to the <trimsite> directory, etc).
* The render method is now altered so that it doesn't work out the menu -every- time it's 
  called!
* It's also possible to set {{content}} and call render just once to render the whole page.

Version: 3.41
Notes:   Made the path parameter optional, so default is "" (i.e. page is in root 
         directory).

Notes:
Updated for trimsite 3.4:
* Main change is the introduction of "path" when webpage class is instantiated.  Although 
  this makes TrimSite just a tad more complicated, going against the KISS mantra, it 
  allows more flexibility when adding in extras.  Hopefully it will make for a smooth 
  transition to TrimSitePlus.  Maybe...
* Updated the documentation to reflect the changes; and 
* One or two other small changes made.

Notes:
a tidy-up for trimsite3:
* Mainly updated the documentation to reflect the changes; and 
* One or two small changes elsewhere that I'd missed.

--- end of update ---

Time: 	11-09-15, 16:09h
Coder:	David
Notes:
Major update from trimsite2 to trimsite3:
* Renamed <library> to become <trimsite>, and altered all references to this directory to 
  match.
* Renamed webpage.php to webpage.class.php (as it's a class definition file), and altered 
  all references to it to match.
* Joined templateTop.html and templateBottom.html to create a single template.html, and 
  altered the webpage render method appropriately.
* Extracted the menu html form the webpage render method to create two partials, menu.php 
  and menuCurrent.php and altered the webpage render method appropriately.

--- end of update ---

Time: 	14-02-15, 09:46h
Coder:	David
Notes:
* Made 3 minor changes to partials.php to make it backwards compatible with older versions 
  of PHP; two places where it now uses array() instead of [], and one place where there is 
  an unnecessary use of the new third parameter in strstr().

Notes:
* side-menu.css and fixed-menu.css now sorted.  They exhibit "graceful degradation" in IE; 
  IE9,10 & 11 work pretty well.  Then IE8 down through to IE5 get progressively worse, 
  although there is still a reasonable and working display even in IE5.

--- end of update ---

Time: 	04-01-15, 23:42h
Coder:	David
Notes:
* I've now reworked back-pic.css so it's properly cross-browser compatible, including 
  IE5.  I've also removed redundant multiple declarations.  There is a very slight glitch 
  remaining in IE11, but life is too short...

Note: side-menu.css and fixed-menu.css still need cleaning up and making IE5 compatible.

Notes:
* Using <banner> may work, but it fails to validate in the W3 Validator.  So I've:
  - changed from <banner> to <figure>,  
  - put <figure> inside <header>, and
  - updated trimsite2.css to reflect this.
  Putting <figure> inside <header> means it can be specified as "header figure" in the 
  CSS, so it's not necessary to declare a specific class of figure for the banner.
  ...But I'd really rather have <banner> - it's then clear what we're doing... :-(
