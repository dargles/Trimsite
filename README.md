Trimsite
========

A basic framework for small websites

The original Trimsite is a project I produced to enable quick deployment of very small websites 
(typically consiting of about 4 pages).  It is designed to be responsive, mobile-friendly and 
easy to modify.

The idea of this extension to the project is to take my original Trimsite concept and update it 
so it uses partials and is reasonably compliant with legacy browsers.
