The Trimsite package comes as a working website with three (simple) sample pages. 
That means that, if you wish, you can port the entire package into your webspace 
and then edit it to make it present the content you want in the way that you 
want, changing things a step at a time.  Alternatively, you can copy the entire 
contents of the <trimsite> directory into your webspace and then create your own 
pages from scratch.

 1) You will need one "pagename.php" file for each webpage that will be 
    displayed.  Either work with the existing pages (index.php, readme.php 
    and contact.php) and/or make the relevant number of copies of 
    examplePage.php from the <trimsite> directory.  It would be a good idea to 
    select meaningful names for these pages - you probably won't want a 
    readme.php, but you probably will want other pages instead.

 2) You will need a decent text editor to update the content of the various 
    site files.  Either do this in Linux, or if you must use Windoze, use 
    something decent like Notepad++.  Do NOT use the standard Microsoft editors, 
    they don't work properly and they will just mess everything up.

 3) Once you've ceated the various pages for your site, it would be a good idea 
    to edit "webpage.ini" in the <trimsite> directory.  For now, the most 
    important entries to change are "heading" and "tagline" - these affect the 
    heading at the top of every page.  You will also need to update the "[menu]" 
    entry.  This consists of a number of lines, one for each page of your 
    website.  The name on the left appears in the menu bar as the link text.  
    The page on the right (e.g. "index.php") is the page it will link to.  It's 
    probably a good idea to stick to one word entries in the menu (otherwise it 
    can be confusing for your users), but if you should need multiple words, 
    use quotes.
    
 4) Once you're happy with the entries in "webpage.ini", start to edit the 
    content of your various web pages.  You will see that the only HTML 
    that each page contains is in the middle - this is what you edit (or create).  
    There are some basic rules:
    - Paragraphs should normally be given simply as <p></p>.  Don't mess about 
      with any style changes - let the CSS handle everything, it's set up to make 
      sure that the page content displays correctly at all widths and on all 
      devices.
    - Similarly, headers should normally be given as <h3></h3>.  Again, don't 
      cheat - let the CSS do its work!
    - Images go in as <img src="whatever.jpg" alt="[Text alternative]" /> or 
      whatever; the same rationale applies.
      
 5) When you've made a change, you really ought to:
    - update the @version line towards the top of the file; and
    - update the updates.txt file in the <trimsite/documentation> directory.
    It's important to make a note of the changes you make and when you made them.

If you want to add another page to your site:

 6) Open the <trimsite> directory and *copy!* "examplePage.php" into the main web  
    folder.  Make sure you copy this file rather than moving it!  
    
 7) Rename the file to be whatever you want to call it - but it *must* end in 
    ".php".
    
 8) Before the new page will show up on the website, you need to add it into 
    the menu.  To do this, edit "webpage.ini" in the <trimsite> sub-directory.  
    Identify the line: [menu] and insert a line like this:
      Pagename = newPage.php
    where "Pagename" is the entry you want to appear in the menu, and 
    "newPage.php" is the name you gave the page you've created.
    Make sure you've saved the updated version of webpage.ini back to the 
    <trimsite> directory.

 9) Now edit "newPage.php" to display the content you wish, as in steps (4) and 
    (5).

10) Now check that everything in your site is displaying as you wish.

11) When you're happy that everything is as it should be, update "updates.txt". 
    The body of the file should mention the changes in this session (in this case, 
    you created the site).  The author line should be changed to your name and 
    contact details.

12) A final check that everything is looking good, and you're done!
 
Enjoy!
