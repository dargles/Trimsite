Notes:
a tidy-up for trimsite3:
* Mainly updated the documentation to reflect the changes; and 
* One or two small changes elsewhere that I'd missed.

Notes:
Major update from trimsite2 to trimsite3:
* Renamed <library> to become <trimsite>, and altered all references to this directory to 
  match.
* Renamed webpage.php to webpage.class.php (as it's a class definition file), and altered 
  all references to it to match.
* Joined templateTop.html and templateBottom.html to create a single template.html, and 
  altered the webpage render method appropriately.
* Extracted the menu html form the webpage render method to create two partials, menu.php 
  and menuCurrent.php and altered the webpage render method appropriately.

--- end of update ---

Coder:	David
Notes:
* Made 3 minor changes to partials.php to make it backwards compatible with older versions 
  of PHP; two places where it now uses array() instead of [], and one place where there is 
  an unnecessary use of the new third parameter in strstr().

Notes:
* side-menu.css and fixed-menu.css now sorted.  They exhibit "graceful degradation" in IE; 
  IE9,10 & 11 work pretty well.  Then IE8 down through to IE5 get progressively worse, 
  although there is still a reasonable and working display even in IE5.

Notes:
* I've now reworked back-pic.css so it's properly cross-browser compatible, including 
  IE5.  I've also removed redundant multiple declarations.  There is a very slight glitch 
  remaining in IE11, but life is too short...

Note: side-menu.css and fixed-menu.css still need cleaning up and making IE5 compatible.

Notes:
* Using <banner> may work, but it fails to validate in the W3 Validator.  So I've:
  - changed from <banner> to <figure>,  
  - put <figure> inside <header>, and
  - updated trimsite2.css to reflect this.
  Putting <figure> inside <header> means it can be specified as "header figure" in the 
  CSS, so it's not necessary to declare a specific class of figure for the banner.
  ...But I'd really rather have <banner> - it's then clear what we're doing... :-(
