In this file, the assumption is that either you already know what you're doing, 
or have already worked through the quickstart file.  The various aspects of the 
example page will be explained.  It should be read in conjunction with the 
content and comments of examplePage.php, and make sure you've read about the 
design philosophy in readme.txt!

 1) The initial comment block:
    --------------------------
    The initial comment block follows the phpDoc standard.  If you want to play 
    with this, it would be good to read up on how phpDoc works - have a look on 
    the web for this.
    
    It would actually be an extremely good idea to update the @version line 
    whenever you make any changes to give the current date and time.  Also, 
    it would be helpful if you add your name to the @author line, together 
    with your contact details.
    
 2) "display_errors":
    -----------------
    There used to be a "display_errors" line in the PHP pages which is useful 
    when testing out changes.  This has now been moved to the construct method 
    in the webpage class definition (i.e. in webpage.class.php in the <trimsite> 
    directory.  If you uncomment this line, any php errors will be reported in 
    the web browser.  However, this is a potential security risk, so when you've 
    sorted everything out and it's all running OK, make sure you comment this 
    line out again!

    The reason for moving this line from the individual pages to the __construct 
    method is that it then only appears -once- ;-) making it easier to remove 
    all instances when one has finished developing.

 3) The class definition:
    ---------------------
    The boilerplate page template is defined in the webpage class file 
    (webpage.class.php) in the <trimsite> directory.  This is brought in by the 
    "include" line, and then activated by the "new webpage()" line.  Don't 
    mess with these lines!
 
 4) $template->render("TOP"):
    ---------------------------------
    Next comes the invocation of the webpage render() method.  This streams 
    all the necessary HTML code to produce the top half of the web page.  Again, 
    don't alter this line.
     
 5) Main page content:
    ------------------
    You should now put all your content in between here and the footer.  
    
    For straight-forward text, you only want two styles.  Sub-headings should 
    use the <h3> style.  Main paragraphs should use the standard <p> style.  
    Images use the standard <img src="" alt="" /> tag.  Let the CSS handle all the 
    formatting!  The basic practicalities are covered in quickstart.txt.

 6) $template->render("BOTTOM"):
    ------------------------------------
    The final active line in examplePage.php again calls the render() method, this   
    time to stream all the final HTML code to tidy up the HTML page, close some open 
    HTML block elements, and to close the <body> and <html> tags, for example.  
    Once again, don't change this.
    
That's it, for the moment at least.  Enjoy!

Don't forget, the primary motivation for this approach is to make life easy, and 
to make maintenance of the site as minimal as possible whilst also ensuring the 
site as a whole is professional, accessible and useful.  If something becomes 
tedious or long-winded, we're probably missing a trick somewhere.  Let's see if 
we can fix it...
